# 2048 (MSCS Department Edition)

This version of 2048 follows the same logic as the original version, only this time, instead of numbers, we have MSCS faculty (specifically, their faces!). 

Players will be tasked with making bricks collide into larger and larger numbers with limited space, in order to make “2048”
